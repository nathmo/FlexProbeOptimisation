# FlexProbeOptimisation
this repo contain code to compute and properties
of an adjustable stiffness force sensor and optimise
it's parameter to get the best resolution possible

![img_5.png](img_5.png)
you will find the parameter in the excel Sheet Settings.xlsx
to import it easily into Autodesk inventor and thus having a parametric desing
